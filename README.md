# Deej_GUI

Simple Deej GUI for the deej project avaliable at
https://github.com/omriharel/deej

The code uses PyQt5 for the generating the UI. The user is allowed to pick the number of sliders they have as well as which processes to assign to which slider.
The invert sliders checkbox inverts the controls (i.e. top is 0%, bottom is 100%). There are also options to edit the COM port the Arduino is connected to as well as the Baud rate.
Finally the user is also allowed to change the noise reduction "low" (excellent hardware), "default" (regular hardware) or "high" (bad, noisy hardware)
